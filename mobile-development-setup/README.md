# 0. Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment Objective
## How to setup the mobile app - Expo Go
## Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 â†’ iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.

## Setup process 
Visit the official Expo Go homepage: https://expo.dev/go.
1. Install for your device:
Android: Install from the Google Play Store.
iOS: Install from the Apple App Store.
2. Open the Expo Go app on your device.
3. Create a new account or log in if you already have one.
4. Document your setup process and any challenges faced in the README.md file. This will help you track your progress and troubleshoot any issues that arise during development.
